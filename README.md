# Ar-Final-project
# 🏓 Ping Pong Ball

A simple yet fun project simulating or modeling a ping pong ball. This project demonstrates basic physics, object modeling, and/or game development depending on its implementation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Ping Pong Ball** project can be used in:

- 🧪 Physics simulations (motion, collisions, spin)
- 🎮 Simple 2D/3D games
- 🎓 Educational purposes (e.g., demonstrating Newton's Laws)
- 🤖 Robotics (ball tracking, interaction modeling)

## 🛠 Features

- Realistic ball movement and bouncing logic
- Adjustable parameters: speed, spin, gravity, etc.
- Collision detection with paddles, walls, and table
- Sound effects on collision (if in game mode)
- Optional: AI paddle (for single-player game mode)

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the simulation/game
python main.py
If this is a Unity project:
Open Unity Hub
Click "Add Project" and select this folder
Open the project and press Play to test it
⚙️ Configuration

You can modify the following parameters in the config.py (or Unity inspector):

BALL_RADIUS
INITIAL_SPEED
BOUNCE_DAMPING
SPIN_ENABLED
GRAVITY
📸 Screenshots / Demos

Add GIFs or screenshots showing the ball in motion or being hit.

🧠 Future Enhancements
